Computer Science 272: Data Structures and Algorithms
Assignment 1


Q1) You have learned some fundamental data structure concepts such as array,
queue and priority queue, stack, list and linked list, sequence, and unordered set, and you understand
the concept of interface or abstract data type that defines the set of operations supported by a data
structure and the semantics, or meaning, of those operations. You can use the interface of one
particular data structure to define or implement the operations of a different data structure.

a. Describe the meaning of the essential methods add(x), deleteMin(), and
size() that are supported by the priority queue interface (5 marks).
Implement those methods using a singly-linked list (5 marks for each method).
Analyze the running time of the add(x) and deletMin() operations based on this
implementation (5 marks).

b. Implement the stack methods push(x) and pop() using two queues (5 marks
for each method).
Analyze the running time of the push(x) and pop() operations based on this implementation

Q2)  Swap two adjacent elements in a list by adjusting only the links (and not the
data) using
a. singly-linked list 
b. doubly-linked list 


Q4)  Design and implement a RandomQueue. This is an implementation of the
Queue interface in which the remove() operation removes an element that is chosen uniformly at
random among all the elements currently in the queue. (Think of a RandomQueue as a bag in which
we can add elements or reach in and blindly remove some random element.) The add(x) and
remove() operations in a RandomQueue should run in constant time per operation.

Q5)  Write a method, reverse(), that reverses the order of elements in a
DLList.
